The acceptance tests are written in Ruby using Cucumber
and Capybara:

    Cucumber: http://cukes.info/
    Capybara: http://jnicklas.github.com/capybara/

Here are my notes on how to install the tooling:

    1. Install Ruby 1.9.3
       Go to: http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
       Download rubyinstaller-1.9.3-p125.exe
       Run the installer, and install to c:\Ruby193

    2. Install the Ruby development kit
       Go to: http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
       Download DevKit-tdm-32-4.5.2-20111229-1559-sfx.exe
       Run the installer, and extract to c:\Ruby193\DevKit
       > cd c:\Ruby193\DevKit
       > ruby dk.rb init
       > ruby dk.rb review
       > ruby dk.rb install

    3. Install cucumber and capybara
       > gem install --http-proxy http://user:password@proxy:80 cucumber
       > gem install --http-proxy http://user:password@proxy:80 capybara
       > gem install --http-proxy http://user:password@proxy:80 rspec

Make sure that you set the proper paths in local.properties, so
that the Ant script can find Ruby.

You may also want to install the Ruby toolkit for Eclipse.  Under
Help > Install New Software, choose the Helios source (or whatever
version is appropriate for your Eclipse) and find:

    Programming Languages
        Dynamic Languages Toolkit - Ruby Development Toolkit

This gives you syntax highlighting for the Ruby source files (but
not Cucumber).

It seems like there is an update for Selenium each time a new version
of Firefox is released:

If the tests don't work, you probably need to update it:

    C:\Users\pronovic\Desktop>gem update selenium-webdriver
    Updating installed gems
    Updating selenium-webdriver
