This is the SantaExchange demonstration project.  It is a GWT web site written
to be deployed on Google App Engine (GAE).  The home page for this project is:

    http://code.google.com/p/santa-exchange/

A "Secret Santa" exchange is a party where people get together to exchange
surprise gifts.  The gift assignments are secret, and the gifts are usually
fairly small.  This application helps you organize a Secret Santa exchange and
sends out email invitations to participants.

This project is managed by Gradle, and gets most of its dependencies from
Maven.  You do not need the Google Plugin for Eclipse (GPE) installed to work
with this code, although having GPE installed makes it easier for you to test.
You can run the App Engine through Eclipse and use the debugger, etc.

Revision control for this project does not include any Eclipse project files.
Instead, those files are generated by gradle.  Install Gradle and then
execute:

    gradle eclipse

This will create all of the files, and then you'll be able to import the
project into Eclipse.

The build scripts are written for Gradle 1.x, and will not work with Gradle
2.x.  Long-term, I want to convert to Gradle 2.x, but it's a major effort
because the interface changed.

I recommend that you install Gradle v1.12, the final release in the 1.x line:
