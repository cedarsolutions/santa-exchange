TYPES OF TESTS

This project has three kinds of tests: unit tests, client-side tests, and
acceptance tests.

Acceptance tests, found in the acceptance folder, are implemented in Ruby using
the Cucumber and Capybara frameworks.  See README.txt in the acceptance folder
for more information.

Unit tests and client-side tests, found in the test folder, are implemented
using JUnit.  The same class might have both unit tests and client-side tests.
You can tell apart client-side tests by their "ClientTest" suffix.

Unit tests in this context are "true" unit tests: that is, they are simple
JUnit 4 tests that do not have any outside dependencies.  To run tests for an
individual class, right-click on the class and choose Run As > JUnit Test.

Client-side unit tests all inherit from ClientTestCase (which itself inherits
from Google's GWTTestCase).  When invoked, client-side tests use a customized
test runner provided by Google.  The test runner starts up a servlet container
and invokes the client side code in that container with a stubbed browser.

To run client-side tests for an individual class, right-click on the class and
choose Run As > GWT JUnit Test.  Sometimes, Eclipse gets confused and doesn't
offer the Run As > GWT JUnit Test option.  To work around this, open the class
in the Java editor and and right click on the class name instead.


TEST SUITES

In a normal (non-GWT) project, I would normally forego suite definitions and
just use Run As > JUnit Test at the package or source folder level.  For GWT
projects, it seems to work better to have explicit suite definitions.

There are two suites: UnitTestSuite runs the unit tests.  ClientTestSuite runs
the GWT client-side tests.

To run UnitTestSuite, right-click on it and choose Run As > JUnit Test.  To run
ClientTestSuite, right-click on it and choose Run As > GWT JUnit Test.
Sometimes, Eclipse gets confused and doesn't offer the Run As > GWT JUnit Test
option.  To work around this, open the class in the Java editor and and right
click on the class name instead.


CODE COVERAGE

I aim for as close to 100% unit test coverage as possible.  I use the EclEmma
Eclipse plugin to measure code coverage:

   http://www.eclemma.org/

Prior to 2015, I used a specially-patched version of EclEmma that generated
coverage information for both true unit tests and GWT client tests.  That
plugin can still be found here:

   https://bitbucket.org/cedarsolutions/cedar-common/downloads/eclemma-1.3.2-gwt.zip

Unfortunately, although the plugin can be installed, it no longer succeeds
in executing GWT client tests when using Java 1.7 and GWT 2.7.0+.  Although
I set a code compatibility level of 1.6, I need to use a Java 1.7 JDK for
development, because that's what the AppEngine jars require.  So, there's
no good way to get code coverage for my GWT client code.

To get coverage for the true unit tests, right-click on UnitTestSuite and
choose Coverage As > JUnit Test.  Let the test suite run.  It will probably
double-count tests, but you can ignore that for the time being.

Once the suite has finished running, right-click on UnitTestSuite again and
choose Coverage Configurations.  In the Coverage tab, uncheck all folders
except src and resources.

Now that things are configured properly, click Apply, then click Coverage.
This time, when the suite runs, you should get the correct number of tests and
the coverage analyis should show only the source tree.
