Things to do:

- Incrementally implement Cucumber acceptance tests for most of the site
- Pull up cucumber, GWT, and app engine stuff into a Gradle plugin
- Come up with a better Gradle way to label code that doesn't require building the entire application
  - This is probably a Groovy method that regex-parses a GWT constants file for String and Integer
