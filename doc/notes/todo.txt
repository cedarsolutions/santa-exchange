Things to do:

- Incrementally implement Cucumber acceptance tests for most of the site
- Pull up cucumber, GWT, and app engine stuff into a Gradle plugin
- Come up with a better Gradle way to label code that doesn't require building the entire application
  - This is probably a Groovy method that regex-parses a GWT constants file for String and Integer


build script refactoring:

  cucumber stuff (with acceptance test)

GWT devmode stuff (coupleed with appengine) -- single cedarGwtAppEngine plugin ?
   - also includes the standard gae plugin
   - includes getAppEngineSdkDir()
   - not sure how I handle the devmode runtime dependency -- manually?

If I do these, most remaining ugliness is in the eclipse stuff
I can look at what to factor out there, too.
