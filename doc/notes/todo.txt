Things to do:

- cleanup tables similarly to what I did in other SE-based applications
- refactoring with new simple action handlers, maybe
- clean up unit tests for action handlers, tables, etc. so they're testing
  only the implementation (not the underlying stuff done by the parent class)
- incrementally implement Cucumber acceptance tests for more of the site
- Checkstyle should ignore gradle suites, otherwise we get warnings about bad packages
