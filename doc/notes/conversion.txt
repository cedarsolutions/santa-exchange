Steps for copying SantaExchange to a New Project
================================================

Take the following steps before opening Eclipse:

- Determine the name of your new project (i.e. BonsaiTreeWiki)
- Determine the base package (i.e. com.cedarsolutions.bonsai)
- Create the project repository on Google Code (or wherever), including for Javadoc
- Clone the project into a local folder on your machine (same name as your new project)
- Copy the contents of SantaExchange (excluding the .hg directory) to the cloned folder
- Delete the following directories:
   - .hgtags
   - www-test
   - test-bin
   - suites-bin
   - war/santaexchange
   - war/com.cedarsolutions.santa.SantaExchange.JUnit
   - war/WEB-INF/appengine-generated
   - war/WEB-INF/classes
   - war/WEB-INF/deploy
- Run change-string to change the copyright header, something like:
   cygwin
   cd /cygdrive/c/ken/workspaces/BonsaiTreeWiki/BonsaiTreeWiki
   change-string "Project  : Secret Santa Exchange" "Project  : BonsaiTree Wiki" $(find . -type f)
   change-string "Project  : BonsaiTree Wiki" "Project  : Bonsai Tree Wiki" $(find . -type f)
   change-string "Copyright \(c\) 2011-2012 Kenneth J. Pronovici." "Copyright (c) 2012 Kenneth J. Pronovici." $(find . -type f)
- Edit .project to reference new project name and packages (case-insensitive search for "santa")
   com.cedarsolutions.santa.SantaExchange.JUnit -> com.cedarsolutions.bonsai.BonsaiTreeWiki.JUnit
   santaexchange -> bonsaitreewiki
- Edit .factorypath and change SantaExchange to your new project name
- Edit .hgignore to reference paths in your new project (case-insensitive search for "santa")

At this point, you can open the project in Eclipse.

- Rename war/SantaExchange.html to BonsaiTreeWiki.html
- Rename war/SantaExchange.css to BonsaiTreeWiki.css
- Rename resources/santa-exchange.properties to bonsaitreewiki.properties
- Rename various top-level files to suit the new project:
   - SantaExchange.gwt.xml -> BonsaiTreeWiki.gwt.xml
   - SantaExchange.java -> BonsaiTreeWiki.java
   - SantaExchangeConfig.java -> BonsaiTreeWikiConfig.java
   - SantaExchangeConstants.java -> BonsaiTreeWikiConstants.java
   - SantaExchangeCustomLogger.java -> BonsaiTreeWikiCustomLogger.java
   - SantaExchangeEventTypes.java -> BonsaiTreeWikiEventTypes.java
   - SantaExchangeGinModule.java -> BonsaiTreeWikiGinModule.java
   - SantaExchangeMessages.java -> BonsaiTreeWikiMessages.java
- Edit war/WEB-INF/web.xml to change name of starting HTML file
- Edit war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml to change the name of the application
- Edit war/WEB-INF/rpc-servlet.xml
   - change RPC paths
   - reference bonsaitreewiki rather than santaexchange
   - reference bonsaitreewiki.properties rather than santa-exchange.properties
   - reference com.cedarsolutions.bonsai rather than com.cedarsolutions.santa
- Edit README and update to match new project
- Edit build.properties
- Edit build.xml and change the project name
- Edit Changelog and trim it down to a single unreleased version
- Edit LICENSE and change the copyright date
- Edit doc/README.license and change the references to SantaExchange
- Edit doc/standards/CheckstyleSuppressions.txt
- Edit acceptance/README.txt and remove the part about what is covered
- Edit acceptance/cucumber.properties and change SantaExchange references
- Edit BonsaiTreeWiki.gwt.xml and change the entry point class and the module rename option
- Edit ClientTestCase to change the entry point class in getModule()
- Edit the templates in resources/templates/bugreport
- Edit the templates in resources/templates/notification
- Edit resources/bonsai.properties
- Edit resources/managed-entities.txt
- Using Eclipse, rename the com.cedarsolutions.santa package to com.cedarsolutions.bonsai (src and test)
- Run organize imports in the test folder, to eliminate extra imports caused by the refactor
- Search for "com.cedarsolutions.santa" in the remaining codebase and fix it (mostly *.ui.xml)
- Edit BonsaiTreeWikiConfig and change configuration to suit the new application
- Edit BonsaiTreeWikiConstants and change the constants to suit the new application
- Edit all of the acceptance test files to make them work for the new application.
  Since the SantaExchange tests are already pretty limited, and focus on the common
  functionality that will be shared, this is straightforward:
   - Change "Santa Exchange" to "Bonsai Tree"
   - Change Google Code URL
   - Change App Engine admin console URL
- Search for "santa" (case-insensitive) and see what else uses it
- Run the unit tests and see if anything fails
- Assuming that works, run the application as a web app

At this point, you have the starting point for an application.  Commit to
source control and use this as a starting point to begin ripping out and
modifying stuff that is specific to Santa Exchange.

- Create new favicon.ico and banners, logos, etc.
- Update the external landing page and About dialog to reflect the new application
- Start removing all code tied to exchanges (just search for "exchange" and go on from there)
- Assuming the app seems stable, run the acceptance tests

Create a copy of the Javadoc project following similar steps.  Copy everything except
the .hg directory and look through the few files to make the required changes (not that
much has to change).

Finally, release the code to Google Code and App Engine for the
first time, following the standard release procedure.
